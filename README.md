**GreyBox Pentest** is a work-in-progress web-based pentesting box aimed at providing a platform for security enthusiasts to practice and learn about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. 

## Overview

This project will eventually offer a variety of XSS challenges, each designed to test and sharpen your skills in identifying and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities. The challenges will range from beginner to advanced levels, allowing users to progressively improve their understanding of web security.

## Current Status

- This project is currently in pre-development.
- At the moment, the basic structure has been designed, and the focus is on preparing the series of XSS challenges and an easy deployment method for others to download and use.
- The challenges will return a "flag" upon successful exploitation, providing confirmation that the vulnerability was successfully triggered.
- Each challenge's flag can be validated using a build-in validator.

## Planned Features

- **XSS Challenges**: The first set of challenges will focus entirely on XSS vulnerabilities, including reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS.
- **Additional Vulnerabilities**: Future updates may include other types of web vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection, CSRF, and more.
- **Scoring and Leaderboards**: Planned features will include scoring for successful challenge completion and potentially a leaderboard system.
- **Hints and Walkthroughs**: For each challenge, there may be optional hints to guide users, along with write-ups explaining how the vulnerabilities work.
