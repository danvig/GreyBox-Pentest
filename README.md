# GreyBox Pentest

**GreyBox Pentest** is a work-in-progress web-based pentesting box aimed at providing a platform for security enthusiasts to practice and learn about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. 

## Overview

This project will eventually offer a variety of XSS challenges, each designed to test and sharpen your skills in identifying and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities. The challenges will range from beginner to advanced levels, allowing users to progressively improve their understanding of this web security vulnerability.

## Current Status

- This project is currently in development.
- At the moment, the basic structure has been designed, and the first set of XSS challenges has been designed and tested.
- The challenges will return a "flag" upon successful exploitation, providing confirmation that the vulnerability was successfully triggered.

## Deployment Thoughts

- My current thought is to setup this environment within a Linux Virtual Machine that users can download a snapshot of so as to avoid the need to download different Apache or PHP versions.
- They can download the VM Snapshot and run it headless and connect to the instance through the browser on their local machine by navigating to "http://<IP_ADDRESS_OF_VM>"
- Either that, or utilising a Docker container or providing either a VM option or allowing users to download the source code to their own server.

## Planned Features

- **XSS Challenges**: The first set of challenges will focus entirely on XSS vulnerabilities, including reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS.
- **Additional Vulnerabilities**: Future updates may include other types of web vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection, CSRF, and more.
- **Solutions**: For each challenge, I plan to include a solution which can be toggled from hidden to visible and vice versa.
